				Our Story:
			</h2>
			<p>
				Helipupters was founded by Amiyah Smith and Maya Smith. We are two pet lovers who know what it is like to pay those expensive airplane fees. We also know what it feels like to live your furry friend with someone else while you in your family may travel for a few days, weeks, or even months.

			<h2>
				About Our Invention:
			</h2>
			<p>
				Our helicopters are pet friendly. Our helicopters offer plenty of space for your pet, however we ask that if you have mulitple pets that you only place one inside the helicopter. Each helicopter comes with a camera installed that the owner can view from their cellular device. It also comes with a desginated area for food and water.
